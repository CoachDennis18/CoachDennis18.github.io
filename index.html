      <h2>Hello, I'm Ian Dennis and my favorite color is Cavalier Blue</h2>
      <p>I am a graduate of the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering Technology. My time in
        Clifton helped me grow as both a person and a professional. My semesters spent on COOP in a small town
        in Kentucky introduced me to my career in software development.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about developing data driven desktop and web applications. I currently work with Sugar Creek Packing Company
        as their onsite Dynamics AX 2012 Developer. Previously, I worked on the .Net Development Team dealing with their shipping
        system. Before that, I had spent three years working in the steel industry as a student developer, with Nucor Steel
        Gallatin, formerly Gallatin Steel Company.  </p>
      <p>Working at Sugar Creek has allowed me to chase my passion for baseball as a coach at both the High School and American Legion
        level. I knew from the last out of my last game my senior year, that this was a calling for me. It has allowed me to give back
        what everyone who stood in the same spot gave to me. The opportunity to share their love for the game that grew mine with young
        men in the same area where I grew up is truly fulfilling. I am proud To be a Colt and a Cavalier.</p>
